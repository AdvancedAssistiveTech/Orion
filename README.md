# Orion
Used for the development of Orion retail assistant, an Eclipse based sales solution

Orion is still under heavy development. The next step is to add a tool to total the price of a sale

##### (Sale-totaller)
##### (Incomplete)

- Add a function that allows employees to enter the code of a product
  - The system  will then match the code to the product and allow the employee to enter the amount of that product to purchase
  
- After this, the system will total the sale and then allow the employee to add another item

- This loop will continue untill the employee confirms the sale
