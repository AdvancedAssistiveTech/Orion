This is a branch created to address the various TODO comments distributed around the code. 
These usually mean that a function is working, but could be expanded upon in order to work even better.

Current TODOs:
- Allow the manager to vew how many employees have been already registered when registering new employees
- Backup function should also be expanded to save the information about employees that is on file
 
Completed TODOs: 
- When "saving and viewing" the information on file, the manager should be able to specify a second directory to clone the files to, 
  effectively acting as a backup utility
